# Project Notes

## Key Learnings
- LLM integration requires robust error handling  
- Mutation rate significantly impacts convergence  
- Chromosome validation is critical for stability  
- Fitness function design dominates evolution direction  

## Current Challenges
- Tuning Pareto distribution parameters for optimal selection
- Balancing LLM mutation rate with performance
- Debugging weighted selection edge cases
- Implementing sliding window statistics efficiently

## Optimization Opportunities
- Vectorized fitness calculations
- Parallel mutation/crossover operations
- Compressed logging format
- Memoization for expensive operations

## Roadmap
1. Implement population scaling tests
2. Add distributed evolution support
3. Develop compact binary logging
4. Create fitness visualization module
