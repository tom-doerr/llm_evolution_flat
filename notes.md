# Project Notes

## Key Learnings
1. LLM integration requires robust error handling
2. Mutation rate significantly impacts convergence
3. Chromosome validation is critical for stability
4. Fitness function design dominates evolution direction

## Current Challenges
- Balancing exploration vs exploitation in large populations
- LLM response consistency for improvement prompts
- Efficient logging at scale (1M+ agents)
- Visualizing high-dimensional fitness landscapes

## Optimization Opportunities
- Vectorized fitness calculations
- Parallel mutation/crossover operations
- Compressed logging format
- Memoization for expensive operations

## Roadmap
1. Implement population scaling tests
2. Add distributed evolution support
3. Develop compact binary logging
4. Create fitness visualization module
