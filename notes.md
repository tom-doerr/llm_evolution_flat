# Project Notes

## Key Learnings
- LLM integration requires robust error handling  
- Mutation rate significantly impacts convergence  
- Chromosome validation is critical for stability  
- Fitness function design dominates evolution direction  

## Current Challenges
- LLM response consistency for improvement prompts
- Tuning mutation/crossover rates for optimal exploration
- Debugging rare chromosome validation failures
- Balancing performance with extensive logging

## Optimization Opportunities
- Vectorized fitness calculations
- Parallel mutation/crossover operations
- Compressed logging format
- Memoization for expensive operations

## Roadmap
1. Implement population scaling tests
2. Add distributed evolution support
3. Develop compact binary logging
4. Create fitness visualization module
