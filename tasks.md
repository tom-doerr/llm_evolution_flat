# Genetic Algorithm Task List (Prioritized)

- Add test coverage for core functions  
- Develop property-based tests for genetic operations  
- Create concise console output with Rich formatting  
- Consider adding crossover rate parameter  
- Improve error handling for LM timeouts  

## Recently Completed
[x] Add population statistics (mean/median/std)  
[x] Harden LM response validation  
[x] Implement mutation rate configuration  
[x] Add boundary condition assertions  
[x] Improve LM timeout handling with retries  
[x] Implement vectorized population initialization  
[x] Add compressed binary logging  

## Current Issues/Notes
- Need to harden LM response validation
- Should add input validation for all public functions
- Chromosome truncation during creation needs logging
- Mutation validation could impact performance
- Fitness calculation needs penalty system for oversize chromosomes
- Consider adding crossover rate parameter
- Need better error handling for LM timeouts

## Next Steps
1. Add boundary condition tests (empty strings, min/max lengths)
2. Implement property-based tests for genetic operations
3. Add mutation rate configuration
