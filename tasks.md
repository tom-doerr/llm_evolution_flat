# Genetic Algorithm Task List (Prioritized)

1. Add test coverage for core functions
2. Develop property-based tests for genetic operations
3. Create concise console output with Rich formatting
4. Consider adding crossover rate parameter
5. Need better error handling for LM timeouts

## Recently Completed
[x] Implement basic genetic algorithm structure with fitness evaluation  
[x] Add DSPy integration for LLM-assisted optimization  
[x] Set up logging system with detailed evolution history  
[x] Implement chromosome validation system  
[x] Add negative reward handling in fitness calculation  
[x] Create chromosome length limit (40 chars) enforcement  
[x] Implement file logging cleanup on startup

## Current Issues/Notes
- Need to harden LM response validation
- Should add input validation for all public functions
- Chromosome truncation during creation needs logging
- Mutation validation could impact performance

## Current Issues/Notes (notes.md draft)
- Need to harden LM response validation
- Fitness calculation needs penalty system for oversize chromosomes
- Should add input validation for all public functions
- Consider adding crossover rate parameter
- Need better error handling for LM timeouts

## Next Steps
1. Implement fitness function with penalty system
2. Add input validation guards
3. Create test cases for boundary conditions
